## Loops

Allows you program to execute lines of code repeatedly, saving you 
from needing to copy and paste of otherwise repeat lines of code.
```
while(true)
{
  ...
}
```
This what is called an infinite loop. The lines of code between the curly braces will execute repeatedly 
from top to bottom until and unless we break out it (as with a break; statement) or end the program.
